Algorithm:

0. Set Up Server(when user enters start game):
- set up the server
- Then wait for two connections to begin

1. Initialize the game:
- Main menu for the game
- 3 choices
	a. Start Game
	b. How To
	c. Settings
- Upon start up a name is chosen

2. Set up Server:
- Connect client to server
- when connected correctly send flag to server and wait for return flag

3. When 2 connections are made begin:
- Once server recieves flags from clients then it exits the wait
- Server sends a start game flag to the clients and the game begins

4. Game begins:
- Players names are displayed as well as their score.
- The players start at opposite sides of the board, with the ball at the center.
Note:
- The scores and names are saved to each of the clients computers and the scores are only sent when the 
user scores a point
- The ball location and direction are sent as well as the location of the players paddle repeatedly.
- upon scoring the users remain at their present location, the ball is centered and launches in the scored on users area
in an upward direction.

5. Game Ends:
- When one player hits the max score (11) a flag is sent to the server say the game ends.
- When the server recieves this it sends a game end flag to both clients.
- The clients both close the connection and a kill signal is sent to the server.
